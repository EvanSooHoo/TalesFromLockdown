<p>Kiwanis is a community service organization dedicated to serving the world&apos;s youth, and this is a pretty hard thing to do without money.  Every budget meeting in 2020 felt like this - we would run through the expenses, we would address how the cashflow was zero, and then someone would sigh.  There was a really successful Golf Tournament fundraiser, but the event that consistently raked in the most funds was our Crab Feed Event.</p>
<p>Organizations like this were like the light for me - I would listen to my tech lead call us worthless piles of human excretment for not fixing the bug yet, or I&apos;d listen to my tech lead screaming at someone so loudly that everyone on the second floor could hear, and then I would enter a world where people would debate whether to allocate $1000 to a scholarship fund, or a free swim lesson class.  College was like this as well, but instead of Kiwanis we had Circle K and insteaed of verbally abusive tech leads we had actually abusive problem sets.  The problem sets at UC Davis were so hard that they were banned in the state of California.  The problem sets at UC Berkeley, which were eight times harder than those, were left alone.</p>
<p>I had a mask on.  It was not raining.  This community center was kind of like the de facto capitol of Citrus Heights, and we had a student police volunteer group, Kiwanis members, a Key Club, and &quot;Mac.&quot;  Mac was a coworker.  His real name is irrelevant, as are most things that can be said about him.  We had approximately 200 assembled, bagged meals in industrial-grade (whatever the heck that means) fridges.  Though it was a very lucky thing that the weather forecast was wrong, and that we had successfully sold this number of tickets, 200 was still a really big number.</p>
<p>There was a single clipboard with a list of everyone&apos;s name, order, and whether or not they would receive a raffle prize.  I was a &quot;runner,&quot; meaning it was my job to hear a name, run to the kitchen, have someone pull the corresponding meal out of the fridge and then bag it with ice cream.  The ice cream was all stored in an outside freezer, and the raffle prizes lined three tables we had set up together outside.</p>
<p>The walkie talkies did not work, for some reason.  There was only one list.  Occasionally we would encounter a name that we could not find, maybe because the bags were out of order or because someone had forgoten, and so we would have Mac and his team assemble a new meal on the spot.  At one point, while temporarily working inside instead of outside, someone shouted the name &quot;mayer.&quot;  I assumed they meant the mayor of Citrus Heights, and not someone named Mayer, so I instantly looked for the name Slowey.</p>
<p>Nope.  Someone explained to me that Slowey had already had his meal sometime earlier in the day.</p>
<p>There were a million things that could have been done better, in hindsight, including but not limited to printing more copies of the lists and having some pre-assembled meals from the beginning.  There was some debate as to whether naming them was even necessary. Some volunteers who ordered food sacrificed their own meals because of a mysterious shortage.  The wait times were pretty long, especially for some people, but in spite of that most of the people who came were cheerful.  Happy to be a part of it.</p>
<p>A year before, the raffle was not three adjacent tables but an entire room.  There was a live auction, and high school students served as wait staff with tips that would go toward their respective Key Clubs.  There would be round after round of crab, and lots of cheering, and a lot of activity for a single night.  Now we were doing our best to emulate that, but without the luxury of indoor dining, servers, or a place to sit.</p>
<p>Mac said he had a good time.  I said that was all that really mattered.  They had so much leftover wine that they gave it to the volunteers, along with the ice cream and some of the many packaged brownies.  Good combination.</p>
<p>We did something similar to the Easter Event...a little drive-thru with socially distanced baloons that I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to tie.  We had our scholarship comittee meetings, and the awards ceremony was by Zoom, and every month we would check in with high school leaders who were still able to run their own activities.  It worked.  It was not ideal, but it worked.</p>
<p>We adapted.  We got through it.  Now when they &quot;walk the stage&quot; and prepare for a life in college, maybe what they had toward will be something that just comes a little closer to resembling normal. </p>
