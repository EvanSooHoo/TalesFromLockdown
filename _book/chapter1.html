<p>I had the perfect idea for our first date: We would order takeout, we would bring it to a park, and then we would eat and talk at one of the many tables beneath the park&apos;s central gazebo.  It was flawless.  The plan would not consist of eating indoors, which was unsafe, and the plan would not make us reliant on outdoor dining.  This restaurant did not have outdoor dining.  To a restaurant of this size, outdoor dining probably seemed more like an expensive luxury than an absolute necessity.  </p>
<p>I had been working from home for what seemed like a very, very long time. From my window I had watched my favorite season turn into my least favorite season, then from my window I had watched my least favorite season turn into Autumn.  Winter was fast approaching, which in the Sacramento region means a slightly larger jacket, gloves, if you do a lot of biking, and early sunsets.</p>
<p>The early sunsets are the part my &quot;perfect plan&quot; had not accounted for.</p>
<p>I arrived at Tempo Park early, with the food, feeling simultaneously romantic and professional - professional in the sense that I had arrived on time, and romantic in the sense that I had, for all intents and purposes, already paid for the first date.  A family was playing tennis.  There were dogs running around.  The moment was serene, I had thought, before immediately wondering whether she was going to show up.</p>
<p>Two takeout meals.  If she didn&apos;t, I would get to eat two meals, and that would still be a win.  I tried her number again, and the text went through, but she didn&apos;t seem to be responding.  I kept checking the various drivers who drove in to see if they matched her description.  Was I being paranoid?  This was still early.  Finally, she texted me back.</p>
<p>They made a movie about how boring (or not boring) Sacramento is, which I find kind of crazy when you think about how much bigger it is than Citrus Heights.  Even crazier, Citrus Heights is big compared to Fair Oaks.  One Fair Oaks resident once joked that if you ever get lost there, you&apos;re going to have to ask a turkey for directions.  Tempo Park is right on the border between the two, about a half hour or so from downtown Sacramento via a single street that passes through a Walmart, a bunch of disjointed fast food restaurants, and the little three-building cluster you may be surprised to learn is the capitol of Citrus Heights.</p>
<p>She arrived.  We sat at a table underneath the gazebo, as I had planned, and made small talk.  When would the new vaccine end the pandemic?  I thought January.  She was more pessimistic and thought it would be more like summer.  We talked about her government job, and how she did Doordash on weekends, and how she was considering trying to replicate the meal we were currently sharing at home. She also talked about grad school while I discussed software engineering, or coding, or something boring. </p>
<p>It was already getting dark.  It was not even 6PM yet, but this part of the park had no lighting and we could barely see each other.  A group of (possibly) homeless people started to congregate in the area, talking loudly and playing music from their phones.  I had thought about joking on the first date that we would just pretend we were at a restaurant, but if this were a restaurant then it would not have had a good vibe.  The lights were out, the waiter was nonexistent, and the atmosphere of this pretend &quot;restaurant&quot; gave the impression that we were not honored guests, but two people intruding on a space that another group of people regularly frequented to listen to music and talk in darkness.</p>
<p>The next time we met was in Roseville, at a restaurant I was surprised to learn still had outdoor dining.  In hindsight, this actual outdoor dining restaurant is probably what I should have sought out in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p>I had a fantasy of exactly how I wanted my life to be after college.  I would visit my summer boss, as I actually had, but instead of telling me that they were seeking out more senior technical writers, he would tell me that because of my outstanding work and stellar performance, they were prepared to make a full-time offer.  I would return to San Francisco after graduation.  I would find an apartment, eat fancy dinners with friends I had known since high school, and proudly write blog posts about how our company was making the world a better place.  Maybe I would switch from writing back to software engineering at some point, but that part hardly seemed to matter.</p>
<p>I could see myself, in my imagination, heading to work every day on a crowded streetcar and seeing the tunnel surface in the Embarcadero.  I could taste the breakfasts I would be having, see the view I would witness from the campus windows, take part in the product release parties and the free kombucha and the beer.  I envisioned the big celebrations we&apos;d have in that city, and the people we would be celebrating with, and I wanted nothing more than to get back to the Bay Area and be done with this place.</p>
<p>But if that boss had said what I wanted him to say, and if I was back where I wanted to be, doing the job I dreamed of doing, at the company I had wanted to stay at forever...</p>
<p>...then I never would have gotten to meet her.   </p>
