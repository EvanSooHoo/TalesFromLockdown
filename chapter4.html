<p>Mac went home because there was nothing else to do - he simply had to do it.  It was a long drive.  He had a 350Z, or 370Z or something (don&apos;t look at me, I drive a Prius), but that thing got 20 miles a galloon and only took premium.  What he drove instead was an old Toyota Corolla that we joked had so many miles on it, soon the counter would reset to giant letters that just said, &quot;GET A NEW CAR.&quot;  It had to be jumped to be started.  The windows and air conditioner didn&apos;t work.  When he finally managed to find someone willing to buy it, he ended up getting something like $100.</p>
<p>He spent nine hours listening to a book called &quot;The Complete Software Developer&apos;s Guide,&quot; by John Sonmez.  He was of the opinion that Sonmez sounded like an arrogant tool, but that he still managed to provide some solid advice.</p>
<p>Going home was never very enjoyable for Mac.  He was one of the only people who left.  He would encounter high school friends who all worked at the local K-mart, or around town, and he was the one person who chose not to stay.  It was not a town he liked, either.  Entire parts of the town caught on fire a lot, which he always assumed was a meth lab, and in one instance his father had defied the evacuation order and singlehandedly defended their home from a raging blaze.  When he returned afterward, everything in the block was ashes except for their house.</p>
<p>It was small, it was hot, and it was mountaineous, too.  His Corolla felt like a death trap, going around winding roads like that.  He didn&apos;t care, he had to do it.  When he was done with this he would drive just two hours away, to Santa Barbara, and see his girlfriend.  That would be nice.  Then he would stay for a while, because when people work from home they can be in Santa Barbara, Sacramento, or the moon.</p>
<p>He didn&apos;t like hospitals.  Seeing people this sick made him feel things that he, as a young and healthy person, could not fully understand.  Or maybe he just thought that.  It was a distant discomfort, this ominous feeling that something just was not right and would not be right again.</p>
<p>He met up with his family.  Everyone was calm, including his mom, which surprised him.  She had not sounded calm on the phone.  He went to the room where his grandmother was resting, and he greeted her.  She looked up at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>In the moments just before her death, or so he was later told in one of the days after he had left, his grandmother experienced a moment of lucidity.  Only his mother was in the room in her last minutes.  She could not remember her daughter for five whole years, but for a few minutes she remembered everything and said that she loved her.</p>
<p>Then she died.</p>
<hr>
<p>A lot of people left the company in the &quot;year of limbo.&quot;  Some found higher paying jobs.  Some wanted to move, or at least were not opposed to the idea of moving.  Some, as is the trend in many places, simply got recruited by rival companies that boasted smaller teams that put down less red tape.  In a massive company like ours, it is common for people to want something smaller.</p>
<p>I saw my neighbor&apos;s father fairly recently, at Tempo.  He asked when I was going back.  I said maybe after the second vaccine, and I had it, and it really made my chest hurt but with a couple of expired Aspirin I was good as new.  I thought maybe I would go back to the Bay Area for a weekend.  I have been working home for almost 500 days now, after all.</p>
