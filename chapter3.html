<p>I met my neighbor at church without even realizing she was a neighbor.  She worked in tech, which I thought made her an ideal candidate for some persuasive Kiwanis recruitment.  We would build the new Citrus Heights Kiwanis website together.  It would be reactive.  Scalable.  We would win numerous awards and job offers for our brilliant web design, and all would kneel before our combined power.  Also, and this is neither here nor there, she was single and I kind of wanted to set her up with this one single guy in our club.  She said he would really have to be a quality guy, though, and my immediate response was that this eliminated him as a candidate.</p>
<p>As most people in tech tend to do, she disappeared to the Bay Area and I kind of thought that was that.  For reasons that later became obvious, she resurfaced during lockdown.  She asked if I ever wanted to walk and talk in Tempo Park, since there was not a whole lot else to do, and I learned more about her.  She was from China.  She got her Masters at a southern California university in IT, went to the valley to get into customer success management, but realized what she really wanted to do was engineering.  Like me, she had been through a very difficult and discouraging job search process before finding success.  Unlike me, she put herself out there.  She knew state workers from a happy hour meetup in Sacramento.  She was baffled to hear I had not met other tech people in Citrus Heights, as just a few weeks ago she had attended a special event for people who liked using Python for data science.  She said their meetup location was at the Starbucks that was five blocks away from where I lived.</p>
<p>I asked if her mom was also afraid that her takeout food might be infected with COVID-19.  She said yes, and that this fear seemed rational.</p>
<p>We did Thanksgiving that year by Zoom, so I made a steak for myself and bought a pumpkin pie for myself.  Christmas was similar, I think, and in fact I still have Amazon gift wrapping paper that I never bothered to open.  My dad sent me spontaous frozen crab and a very suspicious box of chocolate.  I sent out equally suspicious chocolate orders from the exact same company.  My mom got Larabars.  My brother sent me a Timex with a picture of Snoopy typing.</p>
<p>I took a walk with my neighbor, right after Christmas, through an entire new housing distirct that they had constructed entirely during the lockdown.  She pointed out that the trees were gone, but only some of them.  Not oak.  Oak was a protected kind.  She said she was going skiing the next day, which she was reluctant to do but that her family insisted was safe.  It was the disease that worried her, not skiing.  In fact, she went the year before and her instructor joked that she was fearless because she was young.  Young people do not fear death.</p>
